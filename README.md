## Connection Monitor and Outage Log
 
I'm a copy paste python coder right now, I'm currently trying to learn the language and this fork is more about functionality and purpose at my remote site. 

I hope to use this in a remote area where i have spotty satellite internet. 

I have a relay hat on my PI and it flashes lights when the net is down.

As I said im a beginner and will put everything in the wiki page that got this going on my raspberry pi 3.

### Any internet outages which occur while internet_connectivity.py is running will be logged in the connection_log.log file as they happen.
